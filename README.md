Linkedin Bot that takes for input:
* a search keyword
* a personalized message.  
It sends a connection request + a note to all the people matching the keyword criterion.

For this to work, you need to create a new file in the same folder with the name: credentials.py  
the content of the file should be your linkedin credentials + the input for the bot as follows:

* user = 'thatsyouremail@gmail.com"   
* password = 'yourpasswordisprobablynotsafebecauseyouusedqwertyu1'
* sound = True
* connect = True
* message = ''
* keyword = 'McGill'
